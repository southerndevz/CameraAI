This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Desktop.

I am attempting to get camera access from iOS, Android and Desktop (JVM)
So far I am able to display a camera feed on:

* Android
* Windows (JVM)
* Linux (JVM) 
* iOS _(it builds and tries to run on the Simulator but I don't have enough RAM to see what happens)_

On macOS Sonoma (JVM) it fails.
